# Learning Python

After some years, I have decided to learn Python and I love it. To do it, I am solving Hackerrank problems and you can find every solution here.

I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at nauzet.plasencia.cruz@gmail.com.
